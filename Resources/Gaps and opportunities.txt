Gaps and opportunities
UI components
Charts for trends (time-series risk score, applications/day, model drift)
Filters on lists (date range, model, segment) with multi-select chips
Sort/search on Recent Risk Assessments and Audit Trail
Empty/zero-state designs and skeleton loaders
Toasts/snackbars for actions (submit, errors)
Modal/drawer for assessment details
Pagination or infinite scroll on long lists
Download/Export (CSV/PDF) for reports and logs
Dark mode theme toggle
Loan Assessment form
Client-side validation (required, ranges, masks)
Inline error messages and success state
Derived metrics preview (DTI, LTV) with live calc
Submit flow with loading state and disabled controls
Form reset, persistence (localStorage) and autosave
Accessibility for inputs (labels, aria-live for errors)
Model Analysis
Real charts for precision/recall/F1 over time
Confusion matrix, ROC/PR curves
Model version selector and “active/rollback” controls
Feature importance and drift monitoring widgets
Bias analysis with group breakdowns (with proper disclaimers)
Compliance Monitor
Click-through details per regulation (accordion or modal)
Status trend (sparkline) and “last updated by”
Filters (regulation, severity, date)
Export compliance summary; printable view
Navigation/state
URL routing with deep links (react-router) and shareable tabs
Persist active tab in URL and on refresh
Global state (e.g., Zustand/Redux) for shared filters and user prefs
Data layer
API integration (mock service first, then real endpoints)
Error handling, retries, and offline-friendly caching (React Query)
Environment config for API base URLs
Type-safe DTOs and adapters to view models
Performance
Code-splitting per tab, route-level lazy loading
Image/icon optimization, preloading key assets
Memoization to avoid re-renders on large lists
Virtualization for long tables/logs
Accessibility
Keyboard navigation for tabs/forms
Focus management after actions
High-contrast mode and color contrast audits
ARIA roles and labels on interactive elements
Testing/quality
Unit tests (components, helpers)
Integration tests for forms and tab routing
Visual regression tests for dashboards
Lint/format precommit hooks; type-check CI
Security/compliance
Content Security Policy in index.html
Input sanitization and safe number parsing
Redaction of PII in logs/demos
Permissions/roles scaffolding (even if mocked)
Observability
Basic analytics (page views, events)
Error boundary with reporting
Feature flags for experimental modules
Documentation
README with scripts, env setup, and design notes
Component storybook or catalog for UI consistency
Contribution guide and coding standards
Visual polish
Consistent iconography set (e.g., Lucide already installed; expand usage)
Spacing/typography scale pass for consistency
Theming tokens (colors, radius, shadows) for easy brand tweaks
