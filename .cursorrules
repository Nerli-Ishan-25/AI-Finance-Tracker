# Auto-update rule
When any file is edited or committed, append an entry to Project_log.md using the template defined inside it.
Populate all fields: Timestamp, Scope, Impact, Files, Change, Purpose, Linked Components, Next Step Context.
Always update "Summary" and "Active Tasks" sections when major milestones occur.
Before starting any new task or responding to instructions, read Project_log.md to restore full context.
